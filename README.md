# Project Resume Plus

## _Platform for creating and editing resumes._

Almost every IT specialist needs to create a resume. However, writing a beautiful and attractive resume is not an easy task. There are many nuances of design and information. It can be easy to get confused when putting together your main job search artifact. The "Resume Plus" project was created to create and edit your resume.
The "Resume Plus" website provides step-by-step instructions for filling out a resume. You simply fill out the fields of the questionnaire, where you will be accompanied by tips and instructions, and at the end you will receive a beautiful and well-designed resume that you can instantly print, forward, save or edit.

A unique system of hints and tips will help you easily choose what to indicate in certain cases. With an intuitive and friendly interface, you won’t get lost in the design process, and the fresh design will add more enthusiasm and interesting ideas. You can also avoid mandatory fields if you do not have the information or consider it unnecessary.

The existing analogues are difficult to understand and do not allow for the ease of forming a summary. The number of documents created in them is often limited and requires an additional fee. On our website you can create as many versions of your resume as you like for free, compare them and easily edit them. Try creating your resume on the Resume Plus website and you will understand that job search can be interesting and exciting.
